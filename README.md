# Dijkstra-s-Implementation
This project is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, a classic graph-based algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.

## Overview

The **Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation** project showcases a powerful and efficient algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. Dijkstra's algorithm is widely used in various applications, including network routing, geographical mapping, and logistics. This project provides a clear and easy-to-understand implementation of the algorithm, making it a valuable resource for both educational purposes and practical problem-solving.

## Features

- **Efficient Shortest Path Calculation:** Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph.
- **Support for Weighted Graphs:** Handles graphs with non-negative edge weights.
- **Graph Visualization:** (Optional) Provides a visual representation of the graph and the shortest paths.
- **Custom Input Support:** Allows users to input their own graphs and test the algorithm.
- **Educational Resource:** Code is well-documented and structured for ease of understanding.
